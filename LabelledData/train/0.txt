.@iBooks Well, gossipy as it is probably the time the Prince and Princess of Wales came to tea. It seems to entertain people & it's all true
.@iBooks I tried to tread a line between hand-wringing self-pity and what look like bragging. Drugs are dangerous, but I have to entertain

@Cheeky_Vegan You can recall our interchange about wisdom and so on?
hmmm @TheBenHen Well, cooking eye-watering distress rather than hatred‚Ä¶ #Lynx
@al45tair Fair
If it‚Äôs illegal to smoke in public why the heckfire is it legal to wear Lynx (Axe in the US) in public? Something wrong there, surely?
@vegcornwall @Cheeky_Vegan How can you speak at all, let alone wisely, without your brain? And why isn‚Äôt this as much carnivore wisdom?
Good overheard malapropism: ‚Äúoh queuing up like that is my idea of perjury‚Äù‚Ä¶

@ZombieSPni Have you ANY idea how long it‚Äôs taken me to get my routers and NAT and shit to work AT ALL?? :/)
So you pay ¬£52 for #Destiny blu-ray: the slightest internet spasm & it crashes without saving state, just spews meaningless error codes. Hm.
